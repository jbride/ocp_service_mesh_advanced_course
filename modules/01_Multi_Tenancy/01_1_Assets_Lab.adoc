== OpenShift
Your student lab is built on a shared OpenShift v4 cluster in the cloud.

. Have your instructor share with you the details of your lab environment.
. Open a terminal window on your local machine and set the following environment variables for use throughout the duration of this course: 
+
-----
# Modify each of the following based on settings provided by Instructor
# Afterwards, execute each of the modified commands in your shell:
echo "export REGION=<provided by your instructor>" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export LAB_ID=<provided by your instructor>" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export OCP_PASSWD='<provided by your instructor>'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export SUBDOMAIN_BASE=<provided by your instructor>" >> ~/.bashrc



#  Review, copy & paste the following in same terminal #
echo "export LAB_MASTER_API=https://api.cluster-\$REGION.\$REGION.\$SUBDOMAIN_BASE:6443" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export OCP_USERNAME=user\$LAB_ID" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export RHSM_OPERATOR_NS=istio-operator" >> ~/bashrc
echo "export RHSM_CONTROL_PLANE_NS=\$OCP_USERNAME-istio-system" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export ER_DEMO_NS=\$OCP_USERNAME-er-demo" >> ~/.bashrc


# Source changes so as to update your current shell
source $HOME/.bashrc
-----

. At the terminal, authenticate into OpenShift:
+
-----
oc login $LAB_MASTER_API -u $OCP_USERNAME -p $OCP_PASSWD
-----

. View a listing of OpenShift projects that you have access to:
.. Execute:
+
-----
oc get projects
-----

.. You should see a listing similar to the following:
+
-----

istio-operator       Service Mesh Operator       Active
kafka-operator-erd                               Active
openshift-console                                Active
tools-erd                                        Active
user5-er-demo                                    Active
user5-istio-system   user4 Service Mesh System   Active
-----
+
In subsequent sections of this lab, you will be oriented to each of these namespaces.

. OpenShift Web Console:
.. At the terminal, determine the URL of the OpenShift Console:
+
-----
echo -en "\n\nhttps://`oc get route console -n openshift-console --template "{{.spec.host}}"`\n\n"
-----

.. Open a browser tab and navigate to the URL determined in the previous step.
.. Authenticate using the values of $OCP_USERNAME and $OCP_PASSWD
