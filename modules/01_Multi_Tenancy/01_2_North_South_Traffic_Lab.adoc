== North/South Traffic Lab

.Goals
* Use a phased approach toward management of a microservice-architected application
* Use an API gateway to apply policies to _north/south_ traffic into the Emergency Response Demo application

:numbered:

== Overview

Securing and managing a microservice-architected application is often a phased endeavor driven by, among other variables, the sophistication of your customer.

One potential strategy for onboarding customers on this journey is to start by applying API policies to north/south traffic into the application. Red Hat^(R)^ 3scale API Management is well suited for this exact use case. Onboarding your new customer may potentially be as straightforward as leveraging the 3scale API Management link:https://www.3scale.net/[SaaS offering].

Later labs show you how API policy management (via 3scale API Management) and service mesh management (via Red Hat OpenShift^(R)^ Service Mesh) are _complementary_ technologies.

In this lab, you quickly ease your customer into the management of their north/south API traffic by applying API policies using Red Hat 3scale API Management.

In later labs, this traffic is eventually routed through the _ingress-gateway_ of OpenShift Service Mesh so that _both_ service mesh network policies and API management policies are applied.

== Access Multi-Tenant 3scale API Management Environment

Your lab environment includes access to a _multi-tenant_ 3scale API Management installation.

For the purposes of this lab, you serve as the administrator of your own 3scale API Management _tenant_ (domain).

. At the command line, log in to your OpenShift Container Platform environment as the owner of the Emergency Response Demo application:
+
-----
$ oc login -u $ERDEMO_USER -p $OCP_PASSWD
-----

. Access your 3scale by Red Hat Admin Portal by pointing your browser to the output of the following:
+
-----
$ echo -en "\n\nhttps://$(oc get routes -n $API_MANAGER_NS | grep admin | grep ${ERDEMO_USER}- | awk '{print $2}')\n"
-----
+
image::images/3scale_login.png[]

. Authenticate using the values of the following environment variables:
.. *Username*:  `$API_TENANT_USERNAME`
.. *Password*:  `$API_TENANT_PASSWORD`

== Explore API Gateways
Your lab environment is provisioned with a set of API gateways that are specific to your tenant.
You have full administrative access to these API gateways.
They are the API gateways that you initially use to apply API policies to your back-end services.

. Get a list of these API gateways:
+
-----
$ oc get dc -n $GW_PROJECT
-----
+
.Sample Output
-----
NAME            REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
prod-apicast    1          1         1         config
stage-apicast   1          1         1         config
-----

. Get the value of `$THREESCALE_PORTAL_ENDPOINT` from the `apicast-configuration-url-secret` secret in the `$GW_PROJECT` namespace:
+
----
$ echo $(oc get secret apicast-configuration-url-secret -o yaml -n $GW_PROJECT | grep password -m1 | awk '{print $2}' | base64 -d)
----
+
.Sample Output
----
https://95d1c0a311ba965cd23562164db2126516344b6ff5985b49a4282662181e68ae@user50-3scale-mt-api0-admin.apps.cluster-094b.094b.example.opentlc.com
----

* The API gateways use the value of `$THREESCALE_PORTAL_ENDPOINT` to invoke the _system-provider_ of your API Manager tenant and retrieve details of your APIs, or _policy_config_.

== Secure Incident Service

. In the Admin Portal, navigate to *Audience -> Accounts -> Listing -> Developer*:
+
image::images/3scale_navigate_app_1.png[]

. In the *Apps* column, click the number of existing applications (most likely `0`) associated with the *Developer* account.
. In the top right corner, click *Create Application*.
. Populate the form with the following:
.. *Application plan*: `incident-service_app_plan`
.. *Service plan*: `Default`
.. *Name*: `incident_service_app`

. Click *Create Application*.

. From the `incident_service_app` page that appears, copy the *User Key* value:
+
image::images/3scale_user_key.png[]

. Set the value of the user key as a shell environment variable:
+
-----
$ echo "export INCIDENT_SERVICE_API_KEY=<change me>" >> $HOME/.bashrc
-----

. Set an `INCIDENT_SERVICE_ID` environment variable to use later:
.. From the top panel, navigate to *API: incident-service -> Configuration, Methods and Settings*.
.. Locate the value of your `ID for API calls` similar to the following:
+
image::images/incident_service_id_1.png[]

.. Using this value, set the environment variable:
+
-----
$ echo "export INCIDENT_SERVICE_ID=<change me>" >> $HOME/.bashrc
-----

. Set a `SYSTEM_PROVIDER_URL` environment variable to use later:
+
-----
$ echo "export SYSTEM_PROVIDER_URL=$(oc get routes -n $API_MANAGER_NS | grep admin | grep ${ERDEMO_USER}- | awk '{print $2}')" >> $HOME/.bashrc
-----

* This is the URL to the `system-provider` API manager specific to your tenant that all API gateways use to pull information about APIs.

. Set an `API_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable to use later:
+
-----
$ echo "export API_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(oc get secret apicast-configuration-url-secret -o yaml -n $GW_PROJECT | grep password -m1 | awk '{print $2}' | base64 -d | cut -d'@' -f1 | cut -d'/' -f3)" >> $HOME/.bashrc
-----

* This access token is specific to your API tenant and is used by API gateways to invoke the system management API of 3scale API Management.

. Source your local shell configuration file:
+
-----
$ source $HOME/.bashrc
-----

== Test

. Verify that you can get a list of incidents using your user key:
+
-----
$ curl -v https://$(oc get route -n $API_MANAGER_NS | grep ${ERDEMO_USER}- | grep prod | awk '{print $2}')/incidents?user_key=$INCIDENT_SERVICE_API_KEY
-----
+

* Make note of the following:

** The lines referring to TLS and the use of a server certificate. This confirms secure communication to the API.

** The `200` status code for a successful request.

** The JSON message body that is an array of incidents. Each incident describes the ID, latitude, longitude, number of people, and more. If this is your first time running the Emergency Response Demo application, the message body may be an empty array.

. Confirm that the service is truly secured. Attempt to access the service with an invalid user key:
+
-----
$ curl -v https://$(oc get route -n $API_MANAGER_NS | grep ${ERDEMO_USER}- | grep prod | awk '{print $2}')/incidents?user_key=FAKEKEY

* Note that the status code is `403 Forbidden`. When using an invalid user key, the user does not have access. Your API is secured.

This concludes the lab. You have successfully secured north/south traffic into your microservice-architected Emergency Response Demo application using the API gateways of Red Hat 3scale API Management.

API management is a complementary technology to service mesh.
In subsequent labs, you apply service mesh policies to _east/west_ traffic within your Emergency Response Demo application.
