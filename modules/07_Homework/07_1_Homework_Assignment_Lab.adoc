= Homework Assignment

.Goal
* Assess hands-on proficiency with Red Hat Service Mesh product

.Expectations
* Assignments take approximately 6 to 8 hours to complete.
* Assignments are an individual effort--you must complete the assignment without collaboration.
* Assignments simulate a challenge typically encountered in a Red Hat consulting engagement.
** Assignment requirements are intentionally vague.

:numbered:

== Business Use Case
You are a consultant assigned to BookRetail Inc., an e-commerce hosting platform.
BookRetail Inc. is developing a new online retail platform through which to sell their books.

BookRetail Inc. is architecting their new online retail platform as a microservice architected application.
It has asked you to lead a proof-of-concept (POC) using Red Hat Service Mesh.
The purpose of the POC is to determine the feasibility of using Red Hat Service Mesh to _connect_, _control_ and _secure_ the various services that comprise thier new retail platform application.

== POC Environment 

You will need an OpenShift 4 cluster to complete this POC.
You can order this OpenShift 4 environment in the same way you did for the pre-requisite training you attended prior to going on-site at BookRetail Inc.
In particular, please refer to the first lab of the link:https://learning.redhat.com/enrol/index.php?id=1627[Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Foundations] course for ordering of a OpenShift 4 cluster.

== Business Application

BookRetail Inc. has made available the Linux containers and corresponding OpenShift configurations for  its _BookInfo_ application.

. Create a new OpenShift project for the _BookInfo_ application:
+
-----
oc new-project bookinfo
-----

. Deploy the _bookinfo_ application in the new project:
+
-----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/1.4.0/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml -n bookinfo
-----

. A description and architecture overview of the _BookInfo_ application can be found in the first section of its link:https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo/[documentation].
+
NOTE: You do not need to execute any tasks in any of the sections in this documentation (ie: _Before you begin_ nor  _Deploying the application_, etc ).

. Expose the _productpage_ service as an OpenShift route:
+
-----
oc expose service productpage
-----

. In your browser, navigate to the _bookinfo_ productpage at the following URL:
+
-----
echo -en "\n$(oc get route productpage --template '{{ .spec.host }}')\n"
-----

. Study the heirachy of network calls to the various services of the _bookinfo_ application.
. To test the application, click the link at the bottom _Normal user_.

== Red Hat Service Mesh Operator and Control Plane
The POC for BookRetail Inc. requires the _BookInfo_ application be managed by Red Hat Service Mesh.

. In the same OCP 4 cluster where you have installed the _BookInfo_ application, you will need to install the Red Hat Service Mesh _operator_.
+
Refer to the product documentation for instructions for installing the operator.
Otherwise, repeat the steps for installing the operator you previously executed when enrolled in the link:https://learning.redhat.com/enrol/index.php?id=1627[Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Foundations] course.

. Install a Service Mesh _control plane_ with the following requirements:
.. The name of the OpenShift project where the service mesh control plane should reside should be:  _bookretail-istio-system_.
.. _ThreeScale_ mixer adapter is not needed
.. Global mtls is not needed.
+
You will enable mtls later in a more fine-grain manner.

.. Ensure that all of the _observability_ components of Red Hat Service Mesh (ie: kiali and tracing via Jaeger)  are enabled .

== ServiceMeshMemberRoll

All of the following configurations should be executed as part of an automation script written in ansible or bash.

. Install a _ServiceMeshMemberRoll_ with a single member:  _bookinfo_ 
+
Ensure that your _bookinfo_ project now includes the appropriate service mesh related labels.

. Add service mesh _data plane_ auto-injection annotation to your _bookinfo_ deployments.
+
.. Ensure that all of your _bookinfo_ deployments now include the _envoy_ sidecar proxy.

== mTLS Security
The POC requires mTLS traffic between all services of the _bookinfo_ application.

All of the following configurations should be executed as part of an automation script written in ansible or bash.

. If the _bookinfo_ deployments include liveness and readiness probes, then customize them to use equivalent _command based_ probes.
. Create a link:https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/security/istio.authentication.v1alpha1/#Policy[Policy]  object for the deployments of the _bookinfo_ namespace.
.. [red]#Specify a mTLS mode of:  _STRICT_#.
. Create appropriate TLS certs, _DestinationRules_,  _VirtualService_, etc for your _bookinfo_ application.
