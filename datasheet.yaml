  description: |
    The course description has a 4000 character limit

    To provide enough information for a sufficiently detailed description, be sure that your description answers the following questions:
    What is the specific product/solution that the course focuses on?
    What topics relating to that product/solution are covered?
    What are the main tasks that the student will perform during the course?
    What is the end result of taking the course? What skills and knowledge will the student gain? What will the student be able to do?

    In Advanced Application Management Using Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh, students build upon foundational knowledge of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh. 
    All of the learning objectives in this course are achieved by applying service mesh functionality to a real-world, microservice-architected application. 

    This course introduces students to the use of securing inter-service communication via the mutual TLS functionality of OpenShift Service Mesh. 
    In addition, students utilize the multi-tenancy capabilities of OpenShift Service Mesh deployed on a single OpenShift cluster. 
    Finally, students plug in a 3scale by Red Hat adapter to the control plane of OpenShift Service Mesh to apply API policies to both inbound traffic and traffic between services in the mesh. 
    As part of this exercise, students observe analytics and tracing of traffic in and throughout the service mesh.

    By completing this course, students will be able to:
    * Use a phased approach toward management of a microservice-architected application
    * Use an API gateway to apply policies to north/south traffic into an application
    * Understand service mesh multi-tenancy, `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`, and the Envoy data plane
    * Enable mTLS transport security and set authorization policies for inter-service communication
    * Configure service mesh origin authentication and configure Citadel to use certificates issued by an external CA
    * Understand Istio resiliency features, retries, timeouts, circuit breakers, and outlier detection
    * Explore the integration of OpenShift Service Mesh with Jaeger distributed tracing
    * Use instrumented application code to correlate traces
    * Understand metrics and monitoring in OpenShift Service Mesh and create and collect custom metrics
    * Define alerts in Prometheus
    * Understand the Kiali console in OpenShift Service Mesh
    * Understand service mesh Mixer adapters and create and deploy custom resources to configure built-in Mixer adapters
    * Review 3scale Istio adapter components and apply API policies to network traffic within microservices applications using the 3scale Istio adapter

  description: |
    The short description has a 2000 character limit.
    The short description should consist of one to three sentences
    summarizing the main points from the course description.
    This short description is used for marketing & comms GTM
    activities as well as in the training system, attached to the
    course in all search and catalog views.
